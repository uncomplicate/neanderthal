## Presentations (Slides & Videos)

* [ClojuTRE & SmallFP 2018 - Interactive, Functional, GPU Accelerated Programming in Clojure](https://clojutre.org/2018/#dragandjuric): Take a look at the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVnbNLks2Ow). Neanderthal, CUDA, etc.

* [Bob Konferenz 2017 - Bayadera: Bayes + Clojure + GPU](https://bobkonf.de/2017/djuric.html): Take a look at the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGxYfi3Vi3s) and [slides](https://dragan.rocks/talks/Bobkonferenz2017/bayadera-bob.html). Bayadera is a cool library that uses Neanderthal.

* [EuroClojure 2016 - Clojure is Not Afraid of the GPU](https://2016.euroclojure.org/speakers#ddjuric): Take a look at the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOOYbscyTs) and [slides](https://dragan.rocks/talks/EuroClojure2016/clojure-is-not-afraid-of-the-gpu.html). Please note that Neanderthal became much faster in later releases than it was in this presentation.

## Internal details and edge cases

# Making sense of legacy BLAS & LAPACK

BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) and LAPACK are mature and de facto standards
for numerical linear algebra. They might seem arcane at first glance,but with a
little exploration, it all have sense and reason.

## Where to find legacy BLAS & LAPACK documentation

When you need more information beyond [Neanderthal API](/codox), these links can help you:

* [BLAS Netlib Homepage](https://netlib.org/blas/)
* [LAPACK Netlib Homepage](https://netlib.org/lapack/)
* [LAPACK Users' Guide](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/)
* [Intel MKL Developer Reference](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-reference-manual-for-c)

A more detailed doc for each subroutine is available at these links.

## Naming conventions (briefly)

You see a procedure named `DGEMM` in the aforementioned docs and you are completely baffled. Here is how to decipher it:

* D is for Double precision, meaning the function works with doubles
* GE is for GEneral dense matrix, meaning we store all these doubles and not using any clever tricks for special matrix structures like symmetric, triangular etc.
* MM is the operation, it stands for Matrix Multiply.

Generally, Neanderthal will try to abstract away the primitive type (D) and the actual structure (GE) so you can
use methods like `mm` to multiply two matrices.

It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with [BLAS Naming Scheme](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/520726). It will help you understand how to efficiently use Neanderthal functions and where to look for a function that does what you need to do.
