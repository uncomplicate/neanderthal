## What is Uncomplicate?

A collection of Clojure libraries, currently containing:

* [ClojureCL](https://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org) - a Clojure library for parallel computations with OpenCL
* [Neanderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org) - you are reading about it.
* [Fluokitten](https://fluokitten.uncomplicate.org) - Category Theory in idiomatic Clojure.

## Get Involved

I welcome anyone who is willing to contribute, no matter what their level of experience is. Please contact me through the [Uncomplicate mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uncomplicate).
Here are some ways in which you can help:

## Help with the Technical Writing

* If you are a native English speaker, I would really appreciate if you can help with correcting the English on the Neanderthal site and in the documentation.
* Contribute your example code to be added to Neanderthal tests.
* Contribute articles and tutorials.

The source code of the site is [here](https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal/tree/gh-pages). Please fork it on GitHub, make your changes, and issue a pull request, or simply contact us through the mailing list to see what is your preferred means of sending the changes.

## Report Issues

* Do code review of the Neanderthal code and suggest improvements.
* If you find a bug, poor defaults, missing features or find any part of the API inconvenient, please [file an issue](https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal/issues) on Github.
If possible, try to explain what behavior you expected and why. Bonus points for contributing failing test cases.

## Contribute Code

Neanderthal uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make sure you have it installed and then run tests against supported Clojure versions using

    lein midje

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request on Github.
